# Box_Shooter_Game
This is a two level game. For the development I have used Unity3D platform. This game has the following features:

The first level consits of some basic blocks, and a ball which come into the game scene after the game starts, from a certain height.
The ball has to collect the coins present in the game scene, also there will be some coins cloned into the game scene as the game starts.
But also there are some villains in the game, the boxes which follow the the main game ball, so that when they collide the game gets over.
Also if the ball falls from the game arena, the game gets over.
Similarly for the second level, the rules are the same but the difficulty increases as the villains now have increased and the coins to be collected to win the game are also increased
Finally it shows a Winner message as the player wins both the levels.
I have tried to implement animations, audios, textures to make the game more playful and exciting.
The coding language used is C#, and the platform used is Visual Studio 2019.
To play the game check the build folder and click on the unity file of Roller_Madness.
