# Box_Shooter_Game
Box Shooter is a simple first person shooter game. For the development I have used Unity3D platform. This game has the following features:
1. You have to collect 200 points within 10 seconds, but there are some additional functionalities which may boost your win or could make you loose faster.
2. The first level consists of three different boxes to shoot.
3. If the player shoots the green box, they will gain 5 points. For the white box, player gets additional 5 seconds added to the timer and lastly the yellow box, when shot, the player will lose 5 seconds from the timer.
4. If the player looses the game, they can shoot on the Play again button which is rotating on the screen
5. In the second level, the game becomes more challenging as the number of yellow boxes increase and it gets tougher to score more points.
6. After finishing the second level, the player can either restart the game or play the same level by shooting on the suitable texts.
7. I have tried to implement animations, audios, textures to make the game more playful and exciting. 
8. The coding language used is C#, and the platform used is Visual Studio 2019.
